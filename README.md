# Flappy Bird Game using Verilog & FPGA board
For our project of the course Digital logic and Design, abbr DLD, we have brought the famous Flappy Bird game to life. We believe that given a basys-3 board along with Verilog as the programming language of choice, we can showcase the maximum implementation of the course learnings through a game. Flappy Bird is a timeless game which each of us have played uncountable times, so we thought of making our very own flappy bird game. It is a single-player game and consists of two inputs - up and down which move the bird up and down respectively. The player must jump through the gap between two randomly sized hurdles in the form of pillars as in the original game. The goal is to score as many points by crossing the hurdles as possible and try to beat your personal best and most importantly, donâ€™t forget to have fun!
